              The word <strong>Algorithm</strong> means "A set of finite rules
              or instructions to be followed in calculations or other
              problem-solving operations" or "A procedure for solving a
              mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently
              involves recursive operations".
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, an Algorithm refers to a sequence of finite steps to
              solve a particular problem. Algorithms are fundamental to computer
              science, enabling efficient problem-solving across various
              domains, from sorting data to optimizing complex systems.
