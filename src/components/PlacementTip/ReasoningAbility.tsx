              <strong>Reasoning Ability</strong> refers to the capacity to
              analyze information, draw logical conclusions, and solve problems
              using critical and analytical thinking. It is a core component of
              aptitude tests in placement exams, competitive programming, and
              professional roles requiring decision-making.
            </p>

              Reasoning ability tests assess logical deduction, pattern
              recognition, and problem-solving under time constraints, making
              them essential for companies like TCS, Infosys, and AMCAT.
